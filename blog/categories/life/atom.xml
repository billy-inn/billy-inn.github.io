    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/savvyRL/status/1446234152475377665?s=20">the fantastic talk</a> focusing on career path doing AI research by <a href="https://twitter.com/savvyRL">Rosanne Liu</a> and <a href="https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/how-i-got-a-job-at-deepmind-as-a-research-engineer-without-a-machine-learning-degree-1a45f2a781de">the amazing blog post</a> on landing a job at top-tier AI labs by <a href="https://twitter.com/gordic_aleksa">Aleksa Gordić</a>, I want to share my recent experience to offer a more pragmatic perspective. The position specturm in the current AI industry can be roughly depicted in the figure below:</p>

<p>While the aforementioned posts both focus on the research end of the spectrum, this post covers the whole range of the spectrum from my own experience. Out of the five virtual onsites I attended, I received three offers. One of them was a Machine Learning Software Engineer / Research Engineer role from Google. The other two were both Machine Learning Scientist roles from a large tech and a large financial company respectively. For the offer from Google, the team match process is quite lengthy; I’ve talked with eight different teams inside Google. All those different positions cover the whole spectrum from heavily research focused to purely product driven, as shown in the figure below:</p>

</table>

<p> </p>

<p>It’s a long grind from submitting resumes to making the final decision. During this process, I’ve had more than 20 rounds of discussion with different hiring managers, directors and other more senior people from these three companies. In addition, I’ve consulted with many friends of mine in the industry to get advice.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my job search, my preferrence was leaning towards the research end of the spectrum. However, as the things developed, my perception on the AI industry also changed gradually. Evenutally I choose a team in Google leaning towards the applied end of the spectrum. It’s a team in Cloud AI working on dialogue systems which heavily depends on the latest NLP technology (my expertise), generates a lot of value already and has great growth potential on tap. At the same time, there are also plenty of opportunities to collaborate with the research teams inside Google.</p>

<p>In this post, I’d like to share my whole journey accommpanied with some high-level suggestions and my thought process towards the final decision. Hopefully, this retrospect can provide some useful information for those who are passionate about AI and hope to find a matched position in the industry.</p>

<p>(In this post, I didn’t provide that much detail of my preparations, my interviews, my timelines, the companies and how I negotiated compensation. For a more comprehensive guidance to the ML interviews, I highly recommend the free <a href="https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/">Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book</a> by Chip Huyen.)</p>

<h3 id="the-backdrop">The Backdrop</h3>

<p>Mordern machine learning has produced many landmark achievements (AlexNet, AlphaGo, GPT3, to name a few) in a very short period of time. As a result, AI became the darling of both academia and industry a few years ago. At the start, all seemed to be rosy: studying in AI promises a bright future; working in AI brings money and fame; and as astronomical amount of money is poured into the AI industry, ambitious goals like automonous driving and AGI looks to be only inches from our grasp. No wonder more and more talents around the globe are attracted to study and work on it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, reality comes knocking eventually. A few years into the party, people suddenly realize that AI is still struggling to recover the invested capital. Even where it can bring utility and value, it also brings unexpected consequences, like issues of fairness and privacy. At the same time, the competition in both academia and industry grows fiercely, as more people are competing for fewer opportunities. And in this backdrop, I started my job-hunting journey.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-hardest-step-get-the-interviews">The First (Hardest) Step: Get the Interviews</h3>

<p>At the time I started, I was a Machine Learning Researcher working at <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/en/">Borealis AI</a>, an AI lab supported by RBC, Royal Bank of Canada. I am eternally grateful for my time at Borealis and the opportunties it provided. Since I joined, I was mentored and guided by great people and was privileged to do exciting ML research which I am passionate about. I was able to publish a few first-authored papers at top ML/NLP venues and grew quickly as an ML researcher and engineer. For my detailed background, you can check <a href="http://billy-inn.github.io/about/">my homepage</a>.</p>

<p>So with confidence that my resume was in good shape, I sent it out to around 20 companies. But things did not turn out that well as I expected. Only 7 companies responded positively and only 5 invited me for the virtual onsites. As been told by many and I can now attest, getting interviews may well be the hardest part of getting a job. As mentioned earlier, the AI job market has become increasingly competitive and the expectations for the candidates has also been dramatically raised. If you want to do research in the current AI industry, a PhD degree is usually required explicitly or implicitly, and I do not possess one. Another important thing I do not possess is the legal status to work in the US. There is no doubt that US is the place with the most opportunities if you want to do interesting ML work. My legal status issue certainly introduced obstacles for the US companies to consider my candidacy. But if I restricted my targeted companies to within Canada, I really did not have many choices to do what I want. With these two main disadvantages, outright rejection and lack of response from companies were really not much a surprise.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I feel like that I may get more interview opportunities if I had been more proactive in asking for referrals on the social media, like Twitter and LinkedIn – don’t be shy and be scared off by the occasional bad experience. In addition, have an open mind and do not set too many restrictions on the job positions that you apply for. It never hurts to have multiple choices and you can always decide afterwards. I could definitely do better in these two aspects, and I encourage you to do so if with a similar situation.</p>

<h3 id="something-in-your-control-interview-preparations">Something in Your Control: Interview Preparations</h3>

<p>There are always things out of our control, we have no choice but learn to ignore them, stop complaining, and dedicate the attention to the things within our control. So I proceeded to prepare for the left interview opportunities that were presented. My interview preparations were six-fold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coding: nothing fancy but get used to solving LeetCode problems;</li>
  <li>ML bascis: I reviewed <a href="https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> in details;</li>
  <li>CS basics: I reviewed the classic <a href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">CSAPP</a> roughly;</li>
  <li>ML system design: the free book <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/machine-learning-systems-design">machine learning systems design</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro">Chip Huyen</a> is a good one and don’t forget to have some mock interviews;</li>
  <li>Behavioral questions: get ready and be confident to answer questions based on <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/blog/amazon-leadership-principles.html">the 14 Amazon Leadership Principles</a>;</li>
  <li>Review and summarize my past ML projects, and distill my own high-level visions on AI (both research and applications).</li>
</ul>

<p>These six elements basically cover all aspects you can expect in interviews for most ML roles. Having good preparations for all these six parts is not an easy task. At first, you may feel a bit overwhelmed or even question the necessarity to prepare on something that you think you may never use in practice. But from my experience, it may be good to stimulate your mind with something different occasionally.</p>

<p>Instead of treating these preparations as a tedious task, you can utilize such an opportunity to learn something new, refresh some rusty knowledge, summarize your past successes and learn from your past failures. In my own case, I went through the classic <a href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">CSAPP</a> and learnt the C programming language from scratch again. It was actually fun to use some newly learned low-level tricks to significantly accelerate my LeetCode solutions. In fact, engieering is (almost) an essential part if you want to do impactful work on AI nowadays. People in AI industry are keen to make their deployed models more efficient. Sometimes the knowledge of those low-level tricks can give you extra credit when the interviewers ask questions on how to improve model efficiency. And I’ve encountered those questions multiple times!</p>

<p>The same applies to the product sense, that is, a clear understanding of the gap between reasearch and real-world applications. The complete life cycle of deploying and maintaining a ML model in real-world scenarios is way beyond the modelling part, as shown in the below figure. And there are always a lot more objectives to balance besides that single objective your model is optimizing for. Even though you may not work on these parts directly, learning how models are deployed in practice can keep your ego in check, and make you more appreciative of other branches of computer science besides AI, , and even other science beyond CS like human psychology. I’m pretty sure that there are many hidden gems in these fields yet to be discovered which can also help advance AI.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>In addition, it is a great opportunity to review the work you’ve done in the past and those topics will certainly be mentioned again and again in your interviews. So be prepared to talk about them, and be ready to dig into some technical details if the interviewer is also an expert in the areas you’ve worked on. Also, don’t forget spending some time to think about the big pictures of your field or AI as a whole. What’s the next big research problem you want to solve? Any potential solutions? And what is you plan to use it to generate real-world impact?</p>

<p>In the end, the real goal of interview preparations is to build up your confidence and be comfortable to talk no matter what situations are encountered in the interview process. If I can only give one suggestion for interviews, that is to treat the interviewers as your equal and communicate with them like colleagues. By adopting this attitude, the interview experience will be less stressful, and you may even enjoy the process and learn something new from it!</p>

<h3 id="be-prepared-and-be-cool-rejections">Be Prepared and Be Cool: Rejections</h3>

<p>When I look back, the whole process seems to be natural. But during the process, be prepared for the (almost) inevitable rejections as well as the accompanied pain and frustruation. Do not take the rejections personally and move on quickly!</p>

<p>Take myself for example, out of my five virtual onsites, two companies did not give me offers. Though I thought I was doing pretty well in all the technical rounds, the final decisions may not have depeneded on the interview performances. One position I got rejected from was a machine learning engineer role purely focused on recommendation systems in production. After a frank chat with the hiring manager, they decided not to proceed right away, presumably due to the unaligned interests. Another position was a research engineer role at a prestigious research lab, but the role expectation seemed to be mainly engieering support for the researchers. And no offer was made potentially due to my not-that-strong engineering background.</p>

<p>Though the sample size is small, you can get a sense that the reasons for rejection vary. Most of the time it just means that you and the position are not a good match. There is nothing wrong from your side, and usually you can do little about it (unfortunately). So shake those unpleasant feelings off quickly and focus on the next interview you can control!</p>

<h3 id="before-the-decision-a-deeper-look-into-ais-real-goals">Before the Decision: A Deeper Look into AI’s Real Goals</h3>

<h4 id="the-distorted-metrics">The distorted metrics</h4>

<p>To form our decisions, we need first to understand what we really want to do. This is a key to staying motivated. I would assume that most AI people like myself want to do impactful AI work. We want to advance our scientific understanding of intelligence and at the same time we want to have real-world impact and create value for other people and our society. However, long-term impact is almost impossible to predict. One example is that “the best paper award” is never a good indicator of the future impact to the field. Instead, people use metrics, such as citations, number of publications in top venues and ranks on the leaderboards, as proxies to measure impact. As pointed out by many, those metrics are far from perfect. Worse, only caring to optimize those metrics in the short term actually creates many issues in the current AI academia and industry.</p>

<p>So why do we still use them even if we know that they are not that good? I think it’s because that they are fairly straightforward to optimize, just like supervised learning. We have cheap labels and the gradients (the directions of effort) can be conveniently calculated. Of course, some great advancements in AI have been achieved incentived by optimzing these metrics (e.g., by pushing the scores higher on ImageNet and GLUE). But recently the outcomes from optimzing these metrics have started to diverge more and more from our real goals. With exponential growth of citations and papers, do they really help advance our understanding of intelligence faster? With numbers on all the leaderboards being pushed higher and higher, do they lead to the creatation of real values for the people, the increases in productivity or the mitigation of inequalities? I am really not that optimistic on the answers to these questions.</p>

<h4 id="the-real-goals">The real goals</h4>

<p>However, don’t be pessimistic prematurely. Let’s take a step back to look at the history between science and productivity. Starting from the Industrial Revolution, the advancement of science lead to major breakthroughs like the creation of steam engine, electricity and the Internet. Those technological breakthoughs got widely applied in the human lives and created massive value, including the generated profits through commericalization. A portion of those profits was returned to research and development activities, and subsequently contributed to the advancement of science. The real force under the hood is always people’s desire to improve the general productivity, so that people’s time and energy can be saved for better purposes and the society can prosper consequently. “History never repeats itself but it rhymes.” In my view, AI definitely has the potential to revolutionize the landscape of human lives just as those major breakthoughs. However, its current impact on the reality is still nowhere near its full potential.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, from research to real-world impact is a long feedback loop, somewhat like reinforcement learning. The rewards are sparse and the gradients (the directions of effort) are hard to estimate along with inherently high variance. There are many possible trajectories, but most of them only lead to failure. Furthermore, there are many critical decisions and efforts which may not be even relevant to AI itself. But someone needs to take up the challenges to bridge the gaps between research and the reality, and to demonstrate AI’s potential through creation of real value; otherwise, current AI development does not deserve the attention, the talent and the capital it currently receives, and we will eventually descend into another AI winter. In the end, realizing AI’s full potential to create real-world value should be our real goals, at least in the industry.</p>

<h4 id="like-it-or-not-the-transition-is-happening">Like it or not, the transition is happening</h4>

<p>Actually, the general attitude towards AI is becoming more pragmatic in industry, as I’ve heard from all the conversations during my job search. Even some prestigious industrial research labs, which previously an outsider like myself would think would mainly interested in fundamental research, are becoming increasingly interested in making real-world impact. Sometimes, people may feel frustruated about such a change due to the consequent restrictions to the research we can do (or because we still care too much about things like citations and paper numbers?). I felt the same way before when I went through such a transition myself. But now I think a more pragmatic attitude may not be negative for AI in the long run. Creating value, improving producivity and mitigating inequalties through AI are definitely better goals for us than those previosuly mentioned metrics, even though they are much harder to achieve.</p>

<p>You may think those goals are too grand, but those long-term goals can be decomposed into very realistic tasks (e.g., delivering corporate bottom lines or creating  successful start-ups). Sometimes, people may think it’s all about money. But that’s just how all great technologies revolutionize the huamn society and bring massive common good for the entire human race. The generated wealth is just the effect of such a process not the cause of it. The real cause is the ambitious and capable people who turn these goals into reality.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think a better understanding of the real-world applications should never hurt and usually help the research work, even for researchers focusing on theory. And great theoretical work should always give some useful guidances or hints to the practice (may not happen immediately though). Shannon’s theorem is a classic example. No one can deny its immense practical impact on the information technology.</p>

<h4 id="which-part-of-the-spectrum">Which part of the spectrum?</h4>

<p>In reality, all parts on the AI job spectrum can contribute to the goals of making real-world impact, though with different paths. At the applied end of the spectrum, the work are more connected (or restricted) to the real world; the research end of the spectrum, there is more freedom to explore your interests (of course, with more competiton and higher requirements). But I don’t think the eventual impacts you can make depends much on the part of the specturm. All types of work have a great chance of making significant impact. The final decision depends on what is your own taste and what opportunities you can choose from.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-decision-depends-on-the-personal-situation">Make the Decision: Depends on the Personal Situation</h3>

<p>To choose among job offers, the spectrum of the position is only one consideration. There are so many different factors to consider and the weight for each factor differs for each individual. So here I only list the factors I’m considering with a significant weight when making the final decision myself as a personal example.</p>

<p>Luckily, I am still early in my career and do not have a family yet. I can basically go anywhere I like to pursue my career which is indeed an edge not everyone possesses. I was also fortunate to work at Borealis AI for three years as my first job and have experienced both success and frustration which are all valuable lessons.</p>

<p>When I look back, personal growth and fruitful ouptuts seems very natural when</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are passionate about the work;</li>
  <li>you are surrounded by great mentors, managers and colleagues;</li>
  <li>your current experience and ability are well aligned with your current scope of work (ideally, you feel a bit challenged but not overwhelmed by your work and duty);</li>
  <li>your personal goal is well aligned with the team/organization’s goal;</li>
  <li>as you grow, your scope of work and team/organization can grow with you too;</li>
  <li>have the resources and support to achieve the above conditions (computational resources, infrastructure/product/business/executive support and so on).</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m especially fortunate to have had all these conditions met for some time. And when considering all my options, I always try my best to figure out how likely these conditions will be met. Ask about those things (of course other things may matter to you) frankly when talking to your potential future managers and colleagues. Once you have the answers, the decision should already be made in your heart.</p>

<p>Another thing to bear in mind that things may change quickly and usually be out of your control, for example, re-organizations due to various considersations. The hope to keep things as they are is only an illusion. As the saying goes, the only constant in life is change. So stay adaptive: either adapt to the new environment or change/leave the environment. The willingness to change is indeed an edge no matter when and where your life or career is and do not wait until the reality forces you to do so.</p>

<p>Finally, don’t feel shy or ashamed to ask for more compensation even if the position seems perfect for you. It’s the market that decides your fair value and it’s totally justified to get paid fairly. But also don’t only consider the compensation, especially when you are still early in your career and the absolute difference is not that much. My personal strategy is to ignore the compensations to make my decision first. Then try my best to negotiate the best compensation I can once my cards are all on the table (interview performances, competing offers and so on).</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Now, all is settled and I feel grateful about the whole process I’ve gone through. I’m not sure how my career will look like a few years from now, but at least now I’m feeling thrilled to work with the amazing people in Google. Hopefully, I can also make my own contributions through AI to create a better future world. Let’s see how it develops in a few years!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>不知不觉已经到加拿大九个月了，虽然一路上磕磕绊绊，但一切似乎都在我预想的轨道上发展，实在有些出乎意料。新的一个学期就要开始了，居然有点踌躇满志的意思呢。</p>

<h3 id="section">生活</h3>

<p><em>回顾</em>：一开始真的不算顺利，先是遇到一个不怎么样的房东，lease没到就被要求搬走，押金也被扣了。初来乍到，只能认栽了，接下来又稀里糊涂的接了一个快到期的lease，结果住了3个月又得搬家。不到半年就搬了两次家也是醉了……还有吃饭，理发都是不小的问题。不过慢慢的自理能力也上来了，现在基本上生活上已经问题不大了，现在做饭虽然算不上多好吃，但基本饿不死了，周末还可以做个大盘鸡，炖个羊肉汤什么的，剩饭也可以炒个蛋炒饭，感觉还是挺滋润的。不过刚过来的时候碳酸饮料喝的有点多，导致现在牙齿有点敏感，可惜国外看牙太贵了，有机会回国的话一定得把牙齿好好检查一下。</p>

<p><em>展望</em>：碳酸饮料需要戒掉，甜食也尽量少吃；多多学习烹饪，尽量少出去吃些快餐；多注意一下形象管理，别太邋遢了；还有就是平时多注意锻炼，吃完饭犯困了，可以出去走走，玩会儿pokemon go~</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="section-1">时间管理</h3>

<p><em>回顾</em>：出国后有段时间每天整体手机刷个没完，严重影响效率。之后下了不少时间管理的软件，也读了“Soft Skills: The software developer’s life manual”，加上一些机缘巧合（主要是被网上一些极易被煽动、且喜欢强加意志于别人身上的群体感到恶心），终于慢慢的把刷手机的习惯的淡化了。之前读pluskid的博客，他每周平均的工作时间居然是50h+，当时我也想达到这个水平，可我后来发现这对我来说根本不可能。每个人每天每周的精力其实都是有限的，如果超过一定的threshold，时间和生产力未必就是正相关的。提高效率的关键还是在于每天能否在有效的几个小时里做到专注，用短暂时间片来保持专注确实是个不错的方法（Pomodoro Method）。还有一点就是每天都要对今天要做的事有一个明确的规划，否则很容易在无所事事中浪费大量的时间。现在我平时差不多每天可以脱离手机专注工作学习6-7小时左右了，而周末的话基本只学习2-3小时。</p>

<p><em>展望</em>：现在的节奏不错，希望可以继续保持，还有就是在工作学习的时候还是希望注意力能够更加集中（偶尔还会刷网页版的微博，或者总去看跑着的实验）。</p>

<h3 id="section-2">科研与学业</h3>

<p><em>回顾</em>：过来的第一个学期，基本就是上课。一过来就选了三门graduate level的课，基本每天就是上课做作业，准备presentation，做project。一个学期一共做了4次presentation，3个project。一门PGM，一门NLP&amp;IR相关的课还是收获比较大的。而且作为project在Kaggle上拿了第一个top10%，也算掌握了data science in python的一系列工具：pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost。之后又仔细读了winning solution的code，熟悉了Kaggle比赛的一整套的pipeline。最近自己稍微改了改套到另一个比赛里，用basic feature ensemble一下已经top10%了，可惜这个比赛得用neural nets，完全没这方面的经验，加的feature都一点improvement都没有，各种调参也没什么效果，sigh~</p>

<p>由于是winter term才入学，又是course-based的所以没有认识到太多人，着实比较遗憾，也挺尴尬的。3月份偶然看到Google Summer of Code开始申请了，由于课上介绍knowledge bases 时提到过DBpedia，作业里也有用到，所以抱着试一试的心态去申了DBpedia的项目，没想到就申请上了。学期结束等成绩时还挺忐忑的，最后发现担心完全是多余的，两门A，NLP&amp;IR相关的A+。然后和教NLP&amp;IR的老师谈了一谈，基本上就确定可以转thesis-based了。然后整个暑假就是搞GSoC了，其实感觉前半部分都挺颓废的，随便找了篇paper搞了一下。到后半段整个人才调整过来，边打Kaggle，边读paper做实验完善code。整个暑假还把Coursera上EPFL关于Scala的三门课程学了（虽然Coursera现在要收费了，但我发现只要申请助学金，还是可以拿到verfied certificate），晚上偶尔会自学Stephen Boyd的convex optimization和做做statistical inference上的exercise。今天Google Summer of Code的结果出来了，没什么意外的通过了，一个暑假赚了5500刀，和去美帝读硕，各种FLAG实习的小伙伴差距太大了，说多了都是泪。不过通过GSoC这个项目，我还是确定了自己之后的研究方向（至少是研究生阶段）会在knowledge graph及其相关任务和应用了，比如link prediction，entity resolution之类的。和GSoC的mentor的交流也挺愉快的，之后应该还会继续合作，可能会造个关于DL on Scala and Spark的轮子，想想还有点小激动呢~</p>

<p><em>展望</em>：新学期开始前其实还不确定能不能顺利拿到TA，一方面是钱的问题，另一方面就是来国外也挺久了，然而用英语和人的交流还是太少，有TA的话应该会有更多的机会。没想到的是，转成thesis-based之后，和管TA的教授聊了聊，居然拿到了Machine Learning的TA，offer也很快下来了。这实在属于意外之喜了，一般的MSc甚至PhD刚开始一般都只会TA一些比较基础的本科课程。这门课其实是undergraduate和graduate混合的课程，本来我还差点去选，从需要花钱上课到拿TA，这转变真是让我始料未及。但我其实ML的底子也一般，就在网上走马观花的上过几门课，在Kaggle上随便水水，几次想尝试啃大部头，最后都放弃了。之后也一直有意识的想要加强自己的数学底子，然而进展缓慢~现在反而要去回答本科生甚至是研究生的问题，我还是有点虚的，所以这学期我决定认真准备这门TA。这门课相当一部分作业就是Andrew NG的那门ML课里的，网上Python版本的也有不少，我决定用R全部重写一遍（可能的话，也可以用scala基于spark写一写distributed的），然后就是好好搞定statistics和convex optimization，争取能跟着课程进度把”Elements of Statistical Learning”啃一遍，顺便写点blog什么的。</p>

<p>这学期我就选了一门课，不过是门神课”Reinforcement Learning”由大牛教授rachard sutton亲自上。毕竟是University of Alberta计算机最为出名的研究领域，肯定要上一上，不过看了看材料，压力显然不会小，还有midterm和final，需要踏踏实实的学好。除此以外，Coursera上Geoffrey Hinton的Neural Networks for Machine Learning又重新开了，决定去上一遍。还有EPFL关于scala and spark的后续课程如果开了，估计也会去跟一跟。本来还想上点关于finance的课，毕竟手上有了点闲钱，想去捣腾下美股，后来想想还是算了，就算我annual return能翻倍也没几个钱，投入太多精力在这上面根本不划算。</p>

<p>至于在research方面的话，主要就是和mentor合作用scala and spark to factorize DBpedia。另外，刚来国外比较空虚，关注女明星比较多，所以用新浪的API写了个检测明星微博数据的小玩意，准备维护个营销号玩玩，可能也会根据名人之类的，搞个construct a knowledge graph from scratch之类的玩意。还有想到大公司都有自己的knowledge graph，所以就想抓google的搜索结果可以当做一些research的benchmark或者做improvement之类的。没想到google也太流氓了，几乎瞬间被block，搞得我有些心灰意冷，没办法，只能先抓抓Bing和Baidu了，等程序框架成熟了、Proxy IP池什么的都有了，能大规模抓Bing和Baidu之后再试着去抓Google吧。</p>

<p>洋洋洒洒的写了这么多，对未来的畅想实在是有点太理想化了，如果有机会的话，还想搞篇paper什么的呢。差不多就这样了，希望一个学期以后计划的事能做到一半以上吧~</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>签证总算下来了，从毕业到现在，整个人都处于一种很难形容的颓废状态中。昨天又一整夜没有睡，看了很多博客，看到了许多学长的奋斗经历与学术积累，深感不能再如此颓废下去了。</p>

<p>没有压力的生活往往会让人无所事事，现在的我就处于这样一个状态。为了给自己找点事做，也给自己点压力，所以花了些功夫把这个博客搭了起来。希望自己可以把这个博客维护好，坚持将自己在学习生活上的点滴记录下来，同时也可以分享一些有益的东西。</p>
