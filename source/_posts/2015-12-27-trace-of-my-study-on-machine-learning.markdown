This blog will record the timeline, resources, projects along the way of my study on machine learning since 2015. And I will keep updating this blog.

### Mathematics

- Basics: better to review before real study of ML
    - Calculus
	- Linear Algebra
		- [Introduction to Linear Algebra](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/): a nice textbook in linear algebra.
